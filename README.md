# AzureEventHubExample
This repository provides the materials for the second of three sessions to introduce Event-Driven Architecture, and the role that Azure Event Grid and Event Hub can play. The sessions go “under the hood” and share example implementations that you can deploy and experiment with for potential “building blocks” in future work. They will also share lessons learned from a MVP that included both Azure Event Grid and Event Hub, explaining design choices and some tips for debugging.

This repository focuses on Azure Event Hub, using a Proof-of-Concept example that works with Event Streams and Event Triggers for an Azure Function.

The PDF file provides some background theory, then introduces the PoC, the source code used, the steps to construct the PoC and then some debugging tips.
